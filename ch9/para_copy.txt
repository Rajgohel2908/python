One sunny afternoon, a farmer took his ###### to the market. The ###### walked slowly, stopping now and then to munch on grass. People along the road admired the hardworking ######, though some children giggled at its long ears. The farmer loved his ###### because it helped carry heavy loads every day. Once, the ###### even saved the farmer from falling into a ditch. At the market, other farmers brought their own ######s, and the street was filled with brays and stamping hooves. The farmer bought some fresh carrots as a treat for his ######. On the way home, the ###### trotted happily, knowing it had done a good job. That night, the farmer brushed the ###### and gave it a warm place to rest. A good ######, he thought, is worth more than gold.
